title: Delimited Continuations with <code>shift/reset</code> in Elixir
tags: elixir, delimited continuations, proof of concept,
---

* Introduction

Ever since I heard about those things called "continuations", I've
been fascinated by what they are and how they work, specially after
discovering this thing called ~callCC~[fn:1] [fn:2]. If this was not
hard enough to grasp, some time later I discovered that continuations
can be /delimited/ or /undelimited/. Recently I found several
references about continuations[fn:3], but they tend to be papers that
are hard to read without some prior knowledge, which I don't
have. Therefore, I'm unable to present here some intuitive explanation
about them. Maybe after much more reading.

Instead, this post is about a proof of concept (POC) delimited
continuations library in Elixir. This is the result of my attempts at
trying to understand (delimited) continuations by way of practice. The
resulting library converts Elixir code into continuation passing
style, and then uses that transformed code to implement the control
operators ~shift~ and ~reset~. Theses things will be briefly discussed
here. I hope this may help someone else trying to grasp continuations
and, if I'm lucky, someone may teach me more by pointing out the gaps
in my understanding and implementation. =)

This post presents some (hopefully) interesting examples of what can
be done using those operators. A very simplistic (and perhaps
erroneous, as I'm still grasping those concepts... beware!)
explanation of what I gathered so far about this topic and a few
implementation details I stumbled upon are presented in the [[appendix_section][appendix]].

* Examples <<examples_section>>

Here, I'll present the basic usage of the library and some
examples. For more on [[sec_cps][CPS]] and [[sec_shift_reset][~shift/reset~]], see the corresponding
sections. Several examples will slowly build over one another because
I found it interesting to do so when I was trying to grasp the
concepts myself gradually.

TODO: USE A FIXED COMMIT LINK TO LIB

The experimental library is Campinas[fn:12], available on [[https://github.com/thalesmg/campinas][Github]]. To
use it, just add ~use Campinas~ at the beginning of your module,
define functions to be CPSed using the ~defcps/2~ macro and run them
using the ~runCPS/1~ macro. Notice that the current implementation is
pretty much a POC, so several AST nodes are not yet supported, such as
pipes, ~for/1~, ~receive/after~ blocks and many others.

The most basic example is one where nothing fancy is done:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defmodule Example do
    use Campinas

    defcps ex1(x) do
      y = x + 1
      z = 2 * y - 3
      div(z, 3)
    end
  end
#+END_SRC

Running ~runCPS(Example.ex1(10))~ gives ~6~, as expected.

Things start to get a bit more interesting when we introduce
~shift/reset~. I'll give a few very basic examples with growing
complexity to try to demonstrate how those work intuitively. First,
using just ~reset~ basically does nothing by itself:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defcps ex2() do
    x = reset do
          4
        end
    x + 1
  end
#+END_SRC

~runCPS(Example.ex2())~ results in ~5~, as if ~reset~ wasn't
there. Similarly, an expression using only ~shift~ appears to have no
visible effects as well (~cont~ is the name we give our continuation;
it can be something else as well):

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defcps ex3() do
    shift cont do
      6
    end
  end
#+END_SRC

~runCPS(Example.ex3())~ indeed results in ~6~. The first strange
example is one where we use ~shift~ in a more complex
expression. Let's take ~ex1~ and use ~shift~ in its second expression: <<example_ex4>>

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defcps ex4(x) do
    y = x + 1
    z = 2 * shift cont do
              99
            end - 3
    div(z, 3)
  end
#+END_SRC

If ~shift~ were truly a no-op, one would expect
~runCPS(Example.ex4(10))~ to yield ~65~. Yet, the final result is
~99~! It is as if invoking ~shift~ acts like an early function exit
such as ~return~ from a more imperative language. Notice that we
didn't invoke the continuation inside ~shift~. If we do that:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defcps ex5(x) do
    y = x + 1
    z = 2 * shift k do  # also changed the name, for fun
              k(99)     # here we invoke the captured continuation
            end - 3
    div(z, 3)
  end
#+END_SRC

... then, indeed, ~runCPS(Example.ex5(10))~ yields ~65~. But what if
we do more than simply invoking the continuation inside ~shift~?

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defcps ex6(x) do
    y = x + 1
    z = 2 * shift k do
              k(99) - 60
            end - 3
    div(z, 3)
  end
#+END_SRC

This results in ~5~! In effect, it is the same as ~ex4~, but with ~60~
subtracted from it. Essentially, when we invoke ~shift~, the whole
function result is ~shift~'s body. In this example, the continuation
is a function that is roughly equivalent to ~fn v -> div(2 * v - 3, 3)
end~.

That behavior is changed when we add ~reset~ to the mix. It
effectively /delimits/ the extent to which ~shift~ can capture the
continuation.

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defcps ex7(x) do
    y = x + 1
    z = reset do
          2 * shift cont do
                cont(99) - 60
              end
        end - 3
    div(z, 3)
  end
#+END_SRC

The result now is ~45~. The captured continuation is now equivalent to
~fn v -> 2 * v end~ because of the enclosing ~reset~. Another
interesting thing is that the continuation may be invoke more than
once. The following example results in ~13~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defcps ex8() do
    z = reset do
          2 * shift cont do
                cont(cont(8)) + 11
              end
        end - 3
    div(z, 3)
  end
#+END_SRC

Multiple CPSed functions that use ~shift~ and ~reset~ can be composed
using the /ad-hoc/ syntax ~@[expression]~. We can break up ~ex8~ into
two smaller functions, and has the same behavior as before:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defcps ex9() do
    shift cont do
      cont(cont(8)) + 11
    end
  end

  defcps ex10() do
    z = reset do
          2 * @[ex9()]
        end - 3
    div(z, 3)
  end
#+END_SRC

We can also ~shift~ inside of a tuple literal:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defcps ex11() do
    {
      1,
      2,
      shift cont do
        Tuple.to_list(cont(99))
      end,
      4
    }
  end
#+END_SRC

This results in ~[1, 2, 99, 4]~.

A more bizarre example taken from one of the original papers that
introduce ~shift/reset~[fn:9] is one that writes seemingly direct code
to compute "non-deterministically" combinations of numbers that add up
to a given value. We need to define a few functions that do the magic:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  @doc "aborts the computation early"
  defcps fail() do
    shift k do
      :no
    end
  end

  @doc "tries to continue with both true and false"
  defcps flip() do
    shift k do
      k(true)
      k(false)
      @[fail()]
    end
  end

  @doc "continues with all numbers below a maximum"
  defcps choice(n) do
    # by the way, `if` is supported
    if n < 1 do
      @[fail()]
    else
      if @[flip()] do
        @[choice(n - 1)]
      else
        n
      end
    end
  end

  @doc """
  tries to find all x > y > z with x <= n such that x + y + z = s
  """
  defcps triples(n, s) do
    x = @[choice(n)]
    y = @[choice(x - 1)]
    z = @[choice(y - 1)]

    if x + y + z == s do
      send(self(), {:found, {x, y, z}})
    else
      @[fail()]
    end
  end
#+END_SRC

Then, to find such triples with ~n = 9~ and ~s = 15~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  defcps ex12() do
    @[triples(9, 15)]
  end
#+END_SRC

Running this yields:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  iex(201)> runCPS(Example.ex12())
  :no
  iex(202)> flush()
  {:found, {6, 5, 4}}
  {:found, {7, 5, 3}}
  {:found, {7, 6, 2}}
  {:found, {8, 4, 3}}
  {:found, {8, 5, 2}}
  {:found, {8, 6, 1}}
  {:found, {9, 4, 2}}
  {:found, {9, 5, 1}}
  :ok
  iex(203)>
#+END_SRC

** Effect systems

As the final example, I'll show simple error and state effects built
upon those operators. It has been observed that delimited
continuations can be used to model effect systems[fn:13] [fn:14].

The simplest one is the error effect. Reminding ourselves of example
[[example_ex4][~ex4~]], an early exit would be implemented as simply as calling
~shift~. To add extra spice, we'll consider /recoverable/ exceptions:
the user provides a handler that receives the error ~e~ and decides if
computation should halt and return ~{:error, e}~, or if it should
continue (and provide a value back to the computation).

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   # the program
  defmodule ErrorExample do
    use Campinas
    alias Campinas.Effects.Error

    defcps program1(x) do
      y = x * x - 1

      if y < 0 do
        @[Error.error(:negative)]
      end

      result =
      if y > 100 do
        @[Error.error({:too_big, y})]
      else
        div(y, 2)
      end

      result - 1
    end
  end

  # the usage
  handler = fn
    {:too_big, n} ->
      send(self(), {:big_number, n})

    if rem(n, 2) == 0 do
      {:cont, 0}
    else
      :halt
    end

    e ->
      send(self(), {:some_error, e})
    :halt
  end

  run_error(ErrorExample.program1(2), handler)
  # should return `{:ok, 0}` without calling the handler

  run_error(ErrorExample.program1(11), handler)
  # should return `{:ok, -1}` and call the handler, which continues

  run_error(ErrorExample.program1(0), handler)
  # returns `{:error, :negative}` and call the handler, which aborts
#+END_SRC

The state effect is our last example. It has two operations: ~get/0~,
which simply reads the current state, and ~set/1~, which defines a new
state. The stateful program is run by being fed to ~run_state/2~ along
with the initial state. This returns ~{:ok, result, final_state}~.

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  # the program
  defmodule StateExample do
    use Campinas
    alias Campinas.Effects.State

    defcps program1(x) do
      s1 = @[State.get()]
      s2 = x + s1

      if rem(s2, 2) == 0 do
        @[State.set(s2 + 11)]
      else
        @[State.set(4 * s2)]
      end

      2 * s2 + 1
    end
  end

  # the usage
  run_state(StateCases.program1(11), 20)
  # returns `{:ok, 63, 124}`; 63 is the result; 124 is the final state

  run_state(StateCases.program1(10), 20)
  # returns `{:ok, 61, 41}`; 61 is the result; 41 is the final state
#+END_SRC

Notice that there is no mutation involved, nor exceptions being
raised/thrown (in the Elixir/Erlang sense) in those examples. ;)

* Limitations

I have not implemented several AST node possibilities in the
transformation, so almost anything outside the examples in the tests
will probably not work. =)

The example from the composable-continuation tutorial on the Scheme
Wiki does not work with the current version. I believe that
~Enum.each~ (the equivalent of ~for-each~ there) would need to be
CPSed for that to work.

** Continuation Passing Style (CPS) <<sec_cps>>

 This sections describes briefly what CPS is and some decisions that I
 had to make in the implementation in order for it to work. Although
 I'm still making sense of them 🙈.

 A continuation is the materialization of "what comes next" at a given
 point of execution of a program. Or, a continuation is the evaluation
 context surrounding the /reducible expression/ (/redex/)[fn:4]. Using
 the same example from the Racket documentation:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   #  continuation
   # ↓↓↓↓
     4 - (1 + 1)
   #     ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
   #      redex
 #+END_SRC

 Here, in order for the whole expression to be reduced, the redex is
 ~(1 + 1)~, and the continuation is ~4 - _~, where ~_~ takes the place
 of the redex as it is reduced. As another example:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   def some_fun() do
     x = 1      # the lines below are this expression's continuation.
     y = x + 2  # `x` is the "redex" that is fed here, and `_ + 3` is
                # this line's continuation.
     y + 3      # within this line, `_ + 3` is `y`'s continuation
   end
 #+END_SRC

 /Continuation Passing Style (CPS)/ is a way of writing functions and
 expressions where the continuation is passed as an explicit argument
 to the redex.

*** Irreducible values

 The simplest case is that of a value that cannot be
 reduced further. Using the notation[fn:6] ~[[ E ]]~ to denote the CPS
 conversion of a term ~E~, the conversion of a pure value is simply:

 #+BEGIN_SRC
   [[ x ]] = λκ. κ x
 #+END_SRC

 In Elixir:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   # a simple value...
   1
   # ... in CPS form becomes:
   fn k -> # `k` is the continuation, to be provided by some other code.
     k.(1) # that continuation is invoked and receives the value to
           # proceed.
   end
 #+END_SRC

*** Primitive function application <<primitive_function_application>>

 Another simple case is that of primitive function application. A
 primitive function is one that is considered a "black box" and its
 definition cannot be directly converted into CPS. I considered local
 and remote function calls as primitives.

 For a primitive function ~p~ applied to ~x~, its conversion rule is:

 #+BEGIN_SRC
   [[ p x ]] = λκ. [[ x ]] (λa. κ (p a))
 #+END_SRC

 Let's take as an example the negate unary operator, [[https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#-/1][~Kernel.-/1~]].

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   - x
   # ... in CPS form becomes:
   fn k1 ->         # the outer continuation
     (fn k2 ->      # ─┐ this `k2` is the lambda defined below
       k2.(x)       #  │
     end).(fn a ->  # <┘
                    # the outer continuation receives the result of the
       k1.(- a)     # primitive function application
     end)
   end
 #+END_SRC

 If you manually evaluate the above expression, you'll see that it is
 indeed equivalent to the original expression.

 If there are multiple arguments, we first have to /curry/[fn:5] the
 function before converting. This is the default behavior in a few
 languages such as Haskell and OCaml, but is a bit unusual in
 Elixir. If we start with the following for [[https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#-/2][~Kernel.-/2~]]:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   fn x, y ->
     x - y
   end
 #+END_SRC

 The curried form (not yet "/CPSed/"), is equivalent to:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   fn x ->
     fn y ->
       x - y
     end
   end
 #+END_SRC

 The rule for a 2-arity primitive application is:

 #+BEGIN_SRC
   [[ p x y ]] = λκ. [[ x ]] (λa. [[ y ]] (λb. κ (p a b)))
 #+END_SRC

 This rule can be extended further for more arguments. Expressing this
 in Elixir: <<cps_prim_app_minus1>>

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   # assuming `x` and `y` are in scope here.
   fn k1 ->
     (fn k2 ->
       k2.(x)
     end).(fn a ->
       (fn k3 ->
         k3.(y)
       end).(fn b ->
         k1.(a - b)
       end)
     end)
   end
 #+END_SRC

 Pass this thing the "final continuation" (commonly the identity
 function [[https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Function.html#identity/1][~Function.identity/1~]] or, more compactly, ~& &1~), you should
 see it results in ~-1~ as expected.

 A special case is that of 0-arity primitive functions. In that case,
 we just invoke the function and pass it to the continuation, as if it
 were a pure value.

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   node()
   # ... becomes simply:
   fn k -> k.(node()) end
 #+END_SRC

*** Lambdas

 The next case to consider is how to convert a lambda definition into
 CPS. To do so, we make it accept a continuation as the first argument,
 then immediately apply it to a lambda that takes the "original"
 argument. The body of this inner lambda is another lambda that takes
 another continuation, with the "CPSed" (converted into CPS) version of
 the original lambda body fed this inner continuation.

 #+BEGIN_SRC
   [[ λx. M ]] = λκ1. κ1 (λx. λκ2. [[ M ]] κ2)
 #+END_SRC

 Since that is quite convoluted, let's visualize it by considering the
 identity function:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   fn x -> x end
 #+END_SRC

 In CPS, it becomes:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   fn k1 ->      # the outer continuation;
     k1.(fn x -> # the argument;
       fn k2 ->  # takes another continuation;
         # then we CPS the body of the original lambda and feed it k2.
         # [[ x ]] k2
       end
     end)
   end
   # ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
   fn k1 ->
     k1.(fn x ->
       fn k2 ->
         # since it is a irreducible value, we apply the same rules as
         # above.
         (fn k3 ->
           k3.(x)
         end).(k2)
       end
     end)
   end
 #+END_SRC

 In the above example, one could β-reduce[fn:7] the inner lambda and
 simplify further. But I'll use this β-expanded version that
 generalizes better for the cases below[fn:8] .

 There is an additional detail about the rule above: if a lambda like
 the above is directly applied in code, as in ~(fn x -> x end).(1)~,
 then the above conversion is the one use as the CPSed lambda to be
 applied to ~1~ (as will be explored later). But if this lambda is
 returned as a value, one must wrap it in another continuation layer as
 if it were a pure value:

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   # the final version of our example, when returned as a value
   fn k0 ->        # ← notice the extra continuation `k0`
     k0.(fn k1 ->  # ←
       k1.(fn x ->
         fn k2 ->
           (fn k3 ->
             k3.(x)
           end).(k2)
         end
       end)
     end)
   end
 #+END_SRC

 I probably have messed something thing up when implementing, but I
 needed to do this in order for all the thing to behave as
 expected. I'm curious to know the correct version of this. =)

 In case of multiple arguments, we curry the function as in the
 primitive function application case above before CPSing it with
 similar rules. As an example that mixes lambda definitions and
 primitive function applications in its body. The big highlighted area
 is the CPSed version of the "minus one" shown [[cps_prim_app_minus1][above]].

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   # [[ fn x, y -> x - y end ]]
   #
   fn k0 ->                        # ← that extra continuation layer
     k0.(fn k1 ->                  # ─┐
       k1.(fn x ->                 # ─┘ stuff for the `x` argument
         fn k3 ->
           k3.(fn y ->
             fn k4 ->
               (fn k1 ->           # ─┐
                 (fn k2 ->         #  │
                   k2.(x)          #  │
                 end).(fn a ->     #  │ this is the CPSed version of
                   (fn k3 ->       #  │ the "minus one" function
                     k3.(y)        #  │ shown above...
                   end).(fn b ->   #  │
                     k1.(a - b)    #  │
                   end)            #  │
                 end)              #  │
               end).(k4)           # ─┘ ... applied to the inner continuation
             end                   #    from the lambda
           end)
         end
       end)
     end)
   end
 #+END_SRC

 This is already quite unwieldy, and anything more complicated tend to
 grow quite fast in complexity. A good exercise is to take these more
 basic examples and try to β-reduce them manually to get more intuition
 of what-flows-where.

 We give the 0-arity case a slightly different treatment: we transform
 the lambda body, wrap the result in a 0-arity lambda and return that
 to a continuation.

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   fn -> :result end
   # ... becomes:
   fn k0 ->             # again, extra continuation layer
     k0.(fn k1 ->
       k1.(fn ->        # notice that there is no argument here
         fn k2 ->       # ─┐
           k2.(:result) #  │ lambda body converted
         end            # ─┘
       end)
     end)
   end
 #+END_SRC

*** Function application

 The last type of terms I'll attempt to show here is the application of
 functions to values. The implementation differentiates 3 sub-cases: i)
 application of values to a lambda literal; ii) application to a named
 lambda; iii) primitive function application. The last case was already
 covered [[primitive_function_application][above]], and it is things of the form ~fun(x)~ and
 ~Node.ping()~. Case (i) is special because we use the converted lambda
 version without the extra continuation layer. Finally, case (ii) is
 treated specially because we assume that such function has already
 been curried and CPSed, so we do not convert it further and simply
 apply it using the rules that will be shown below.

 The conversion rule for an application is:

 #+BEGIN_SRC
   [[ M N ]] = λκ. [[ M ]] (λm. [[ N ]] (λn. m n κ))
 #+END_SRC

 As a final example, we consider the application to a named lambda.

 #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
   some_fun.(1)
   # ... becomes
   fn k1 ->
     some_fun.(fn m ->   # ← `some_fun` is considered already CPSed
       (fn k2 ->
         k2.(1)          # ← CPSed argument
       end).(fn n ->
         m.(n).(k1)
       end)
     end)
   end
 #+END_SRC

*** Other details

 For more details, I'll refer the reader to the implementation and to
 some papers that describe the transformation [GH LINK] [FIX DUP

** Shift / Reset <<sec_shift_reset>>

 Ok, that was quite a lot... Why go through all this trouble?

 The answer is that such transformations allow us to use some control
 operators that are quite powerful. Some examples of applications that
 can be implemented as libraries are: exceptions, backtracking search,
 threads, generators and coroutines [fn:10].

 Two of those operators are ~shift~ and ~reset~, and there are a few
 other more or less equivalent ones [fn:11]. They are most succinctly
 conceptually described in the Racket documentation by the reduction
 rules:

 #+BEGIN_SRC racket
   ;; "=>" means "reduces to"
   (reset val) => val
   (reset E[(shift k expr)]) => (reset (λ (k) expr)
                                       (λ (v) (reset E[v])))
   ;; where `E` has no `reset`
 #+END_SRC

[fn:8] It is also one point that I could not understand quite well
when reading the papers. I needed to do this for the implementation to
work properly for my test cases, but the equations in [fn:6] are
somewhat different.
