title: About
---

I'm a software developer currently based in Brazil and with experience
in web backends. Occasionally dabbles with the frontend and
infrastructure. The kinds of programming languages I like the most are
strongly typed ones, like Haskell, OCaml, Rust and similar friends. I
also enjoy learning new stuff that help me think in different ways.
